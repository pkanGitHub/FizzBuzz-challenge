# FizzBuzz-challenge

The code in the main branch is the final version merged from branch 3. 

# Structure in this repo

### first-version branch 
  - I wrote out the code and make sure the program works.
### improve-efficiency branch 
  - Since I think I already made the first branch of FizzBuzz as simple as it can be, and not feeling like  putting identical code into branch 2 and branch 3. I decided to add a new feature for this program for this branch.
### clean-up-program branch
  - This branch is to clean up some comments. And implement an error check which I forgot to in branch 2, and makes the program looks more friendly when it's run.
